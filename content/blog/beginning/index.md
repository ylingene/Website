Moving to California has been a new chapter for my photography as well as my life. Since when I 
first began photography, my photo subject matter has gradually transitioned from people to 
everyday environments. 

I'm inspired by background environments in film and animation. Some noteable works have been 
Makoto Shinkai's Your Name and Kyoto Animation's Violet Evergarden. The photos here were taken 
while I have lived in California since 2018. Places include San Francisco and San Diego.
