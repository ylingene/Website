For a number of years, I've wanted to see cherry blossoms in Japan. I took the first opportunity
I could in spring 2019. Since I visited Japan the year before, I went several more cities in my
two week trip. I visited Fukuoka, Yakushima, Kagoshima, Kyoto, Tokyo, Mt. Fuji, Saitama, Yamagata,
and Hokkaido.

The second half of my trip was traveling solo. It was eye-opening learning to be comfortable going
at my own pace and appreciating the time alone. My favorite parts of the trip were driving and
exploring Yakushima, the island that inspired the environments of Studio Ghibli's Princess Mononoke,
eating a variety of amazing food, and seeing the beautiful cherry blossoms.
