Having grown up on the east coast, I often find myself longing for the warm summer evenings,
crisp winter air, and distinct nature and foliage. I loved peering into my backyard with the
dappled sunlight illuminating through tall maple trees on a summer afternoon.

This collection features scenes from New York City, Massachusetts, Maine, and New Hampshire during
the summer and fall seasons.
